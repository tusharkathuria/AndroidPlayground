This is a playground module to explore [Dagger](https://dagger.dev/) dependency injection framework. This was built while going through this awesome youtube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrnPJCHvNZuA2ioi4soDZKz8euUQnJW65). I highly recommend you to go through it if you want to learn Dagger.
If you understand Dagger well, then understanding hilt won't be a problem for you.
